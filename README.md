## Arrange >> Act >> Assert with Valadate

For Vala developers who need to test their code, Valadate is a powerful testing framework that provides behavioral, functional and unit testing features to help them write great Open Source software. Unlike other testing frameworks, Valadate is designed especially for Vala while integrating seamlessly into existing toolchains.

### Installation

#### From Source

```bash
./autogen.sh
make
# as root
make install
```

#### Debian

Add the repository's key
```
curl https://www.valadate.org/jenkins@valadate.org.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```
Add the following repository to your software sources:
```
deb	https://www.valadate.org/repos/debian valadate main
```
Then you can install with:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install valadate
```

#### Fedora 23

Add the following to /etc/yum.repos.d/valadate.repo

```
[valadate]
name=valadate
baseurl=http://www.valadate.org/repos/fedora/$releasever/$basearch
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=http://www.valadate.org/jenkins@valadate.org.gpg.key
```

Then run with root privileges:

```
dnf update
dnf install valadate
```

### Usage

Once correctly installed and configured, Valadate makes writing tests as simple as:

```vala
public class BookTest : Valadate.Framework.TestCase {

	public void test_construct_book() {
		
		// Arrange ...
		
		// Act ...
		
		// Assert ...
	}
}

$ valac --library mytest-0 --gir mytest-0.gir --pkg valadate-1.0 -X -pie -X -fPIE mytest-0.vala

$ ./mtest-0

/LibraryBookTest/test_construct_book: OK
```

To run with [TAP](https://testanything.org/) output:

```
$ ./mtest-0 --tap

# random seed: R02Sddf35dad90ff6d1b6603ccb68028a4f0

1..1

# Start of LibraryBookTest tests

ok 1 /LibraryBookTest/test_construct_book

# End of LibraryBookTest tests
```

The ```[Test]``` annotation and parameters are also available for giving test classes and methods more readable names and for supporting asynchronous tests.

```vala

[Test (name="Annotated TestCase with name")]
public class MyTest : Valadate.Framework.TestCase {

	[Test (name="Annotated Method With Name")]
	public void annotated_test_with_name () {
		assert_true(true);
	}


	[Test (name="Asynchronous Test", timeout=1000)]
	public async void test_async () {
		assert_true(true);
	}

	[Test (skip="yes")]
	public void skip_test () {
		assert_true(false);
	}

}



1..3
# Start of Annotated TestCase with name tests
ok 1 /Annotated TestCase with name/Annotated Method With Name
ok 2 /Annotated TestCase with name/Asynchronous Test
ok 3 /Annotated TestCase with name/skip_test # SKIP Skipping Test skip_test
# End of Annotated TestCase with name tests

```
